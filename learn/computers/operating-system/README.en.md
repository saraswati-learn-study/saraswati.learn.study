## Introduction

Your Computer's _Operating System (OS)_ is sort of its "initial base program".

It is a _software_ _program_ not really all that different e.g. from an App of a Game.

Unlike say a Game, an OS' purpose is not to draw characters on the screens,
but to manage the hardware resources of the computers. So the OS has _functions_
that let another program, like a game, draw anything the want on the screen.

Another function of an OS would be to _"wait for the user to type something
on the keyboard"_ (or to _"wait for something to be clicked on or pressed on
the screen")._

## Operating System Examples

Every computer has an OS, for example:

* Android
* Windows
* Linux
* macOS
* iPadOS
* iOS

Do you know on what kind of computers these run?

<!-- TODO Quiz -->

* Android runs on many mobile phones, such as those from Samsung and other manufacturers.
  But it also runs on tablets, many TVs and in some cars!
* Windows runs on most desktop and laptop computers, both in many offices and homes.
* Linux runs on some desktop and laptop computers, and most servers that power the Internet.
* macOS runs on all desktop and laptop computers by Apple.
* iPadOS runs on tablets by Apple.
* iOS runs on mobile phones by Apple.

## Who programs the OS?

Linux was originally written by someone named Linus Torvalds, from Finland.
It is now maintained by over ten thousand developers in an open source community.
Linus still helps to coordinate all of the work they do.

macOS, iOS and iPadOS are written by employees of the company Apple.

Windows is written by employees of the company Microsoft.

Android is written by employees of the company Google with the help of people from the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) open source community, a bit similar to how Linux is maintained.
