# Computer Concepts

## Prerequisites

## CPU

The _CPU_ is the 🧠 brain of any computer.

It is a _chip_ made of _electronic circuits_ which conduct _power_ (1!) - or (0!) not.

<!--
There are many kinds of CPUs; smaller and bigger ones and slower and faster ones - a bit like... cars?
If your teacher has the _CPU Wars 🃏 Card Game,_ you could play it afterwards!
-->

Just like your brain, it "does things" - e.g. like adding up numbers.

Unlike you, who is super motivated and wants to learn more about all this right now, because you are very curious, computers are actually very dumb and lazy - they don't do any work by and for themselves - unlike you! 😄

They always only do exactly what humans tell them to - by providing them _instructions._ On this computer, that human right now is **YOU!** By clicking somewhere afterwards, you are giving it a "move on to the next chapter" instruction.

When you click, you are making this computer's CPU _execute (run) instructions,_ which make it draw something new on the screen. In reality there are many steps involved here, but they were all created by other humans - those who made this computer, and those who told it what it needs to do when you click.

Writing the "stories" with such instructions, like a book, is called _Programming!_ You'll soon learn more about this.

## Memory

The _Memory_ is how computers store things to remember them for you - just like you do, when you learn this!

Computers can have different kinds of memory:

* The _RAM:_ That's actually quite similar to your 🧠 _"short term memory"_
* The _"Disk"_ where your computer stores _"Files"_ which you need to keep

Everything inside the computer's memory is just 0s and 1s. What these
actually mean depends on the _Format._ It could be _text,_, or an image, or
a video - or even the 0s and 1s of the _instructions_ of a _program._

This tutorial is written in a format called _Markdown._

A _Program_ translates that _Markdown_ into another language called _HTML._

You will soon see how you can write like this, and propose to change this!

### External Memory

In addition to this _"internal RAM & Disk memory"_ you may have also seen _"external" memory?
A _USB stick_ or a _SD card_ are basically exactly the same as what's inside your computer.
It's just that you can carry that around from school to home or a friend's place.
Nowadays where computers are interconnected, this isn't used very much anymore.

## I/O

Because it would be very boring if computers' CPU did calculations alone,
and only kept things to themselves in their memory, they always also have
_Input_ and _Output_ (I/O).

* [ ] Can you think of some examples of what may be Input and Output devices?

### Input

* On/Off Button
* Keyboard ⌨️
* 🖱️ Mouse 🐁
* Touchpad
* TrackPoint
* Trackball 🖲️
* 🎙️ Microphone 🎤

### Output

* Monitor / Screen 🖥️
* 🔈 Loudspeaker 📢
* Printer? 🖨️

### Mixed

* USB plug
* Ethernet plug, for connecting to other computers to form a _Network_

## Network

Do you like connecting with your friends? So do computers!

In addition to waiting for you to type something on its keyboard,
or drawing something for you on its screen, computers really do love to send
many little _messages_ to others computers over a _Network._ That's e.g. how
Email or 📺 YouTube works - and also how you are reading this right now!

We'll learn more about this later.

## Types of Computers

All computers have CPU, Memory and I/O.

Can you name some different kinds of computers?

Laptop? Desktop? Are you surprised to hear that a Mobile 📱 Smartphone and Tablet is also a _"computer?"_

Today even 📺 TVs and washing machines and some ⌚ watches are also computers!

They all have CPU, Memory and I/O. They all just run instructions, programmed by humans.

So they are really very similar to the computer you are using right now.

The only difference literally is just that some have bigger or smaller or no screens, or no keyboard.

## Servers

_Servers_ are a particular type of computer. Just like Laptops, Desktops, Smartphones, Tablets, TVs, washing machines or watches.

The only difference is that they are often a bit bigger, and have more memory - but no screen.

They don't need a screen, because they only communicate with other computers, like yours, over a network.

Some of them are physically located in _Data Centers_ - huge buildings with lots of computers in them.

This _web page_ that you are reading right now was sent to your computer from such a server!
