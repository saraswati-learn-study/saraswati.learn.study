# Your Keyboard

Learn how to use shortcuts on your keyboard to become faster by avoiding having to use the 🖱️ mouse 🐁 for everything.

## Prerequisites

## Highlight (Mark)

Text needs to me _highlighted (marked)_ for operations like format changes

In a Web Browser most people use the 🖱️ mouse 🐁 for this.

If you're in an [Editor](../vscode.dev/codelab.en.md), keep the the ⬆️ Shift key pressed and at the same time use the cursor left/right/up/down key.

## Copy & Paste

1. Highlight (mark) the text that you want to copy
1. Press the Ctrl and C keys together (Ctrl-C), to _Copy_
1. Move the cursor somewhere else
1. Press Ctrl-V to _Paste_ it
