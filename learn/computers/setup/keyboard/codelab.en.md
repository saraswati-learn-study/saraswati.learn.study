# Your Mouse & Keyboard

Learn how to use shortcuts on your keyboard to become faster by avoiding having to use the üñ±Ô∏è mouse üêÅ for everything.

## Prerequisites

## Special Keys

The _Ctrl_ key is at the bottom left and right of the big space bar.

The _Alt_ key is immediately on the left of the space bar. It's used for shortcuts.

The _Windows_ key is next to _Alt_ and is also used for shortcuts. It's a newer key that Microsoft instead of putting on keyboards, which older didn't use to have!

The _AltGr_ key is immediately on the right of the space bar. It's used for special characters; try it!

The _F1/F2/.../F12_ "Function Keys" are on top of your keyboard.

The _Fn_ key, confusingly, is not a "Function Key", but used e.g. to increase/decrease volume, mute, change brightness, etc.

## Navigate

* Ctrl-Left/Right "jumps" words
* Ctrl-Home/End goes to the very beginning or end

## Delete

* Ctrl-Backspace deletes the last word
* Ctrl-Delete deletes the next word

* [ ] I typed 3 words and then pressed Ctrl-Backspace and now only have 2 words

## Find!

Ctrl-F let's you easily _Find_ something (like _Waldo)._

* [ ] I pressed Ctrl-F and typed "Waldo" and found it highlighted above!

## Undo & Redo

Ctrl-Z _"undoes"_ (reverts) the last thing you did, such as something you recently typed.

Ctrl-Y "redoes" it.

* [ ] I tried - that's cool!

## Highlight (Mark)

Text needs to be _highlighted (marked)_ for operations like format changes.

In a Web Browser most people use the üñ±Ô∏è mouse üêÅ for this.

Try to click somewhere, and move your mouse, and then keep the the _Ctrl_ key pressed and clicked somewhere else - voil√†, you marked text!

If you're in an [Editor](../vscode.dev/codelab.en.md), just keep the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Shift key pressed and at the same time use the cursor left/right/up/down key.

Ctrl-A selects all available content in focus.

## Copy & Paste

1. Highlight (mark) the text that you want to copy
1. Press the Ctrl and C keys together (Ctrl-C), to _Copy_
1. Move the cursor somewhere else
1. Press Ctrl-V to _Paste_ it

* [ ] I managed!

## Tabs & Windows

* Ctrl-N open a new browser window
* Alt-Tab (and Alt-Shift-Tab) switches between open Windows
* Ctrl-W closes the current browser tab

* Ctrl-T opens a new tab in your browser
* Ctrl-Tab (and Ctrl-Shift-Tab) switches between open Tabs
* Ctrl-Shift-T re-open the last closed tab

* Ctrl-L jumps into the browser's "address bar"

* [ ] I tried it!

## Other

* F11 Enter & Exit Full Screen Mode - very useful when you give a presentation in class!
* Shift-Delete Permanently delete (you cannot get it back)
* Ctrl-R Reload Web Site
* Ctrl-S Save Document
* Ctrl-O Open File
* Alt-F4 Close Window
* F2 Rename File
* Win-L Lock
