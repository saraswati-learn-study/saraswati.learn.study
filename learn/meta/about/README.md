# About Learn.study

## Principles

- We make it "fun"
- We keep it "short" - and link to existing
- We keep it "readably fluently" and "avoid distractions".
  Most external links are typically only provided in _Further Resources_ at the end.
- We make it "practical", "hands on", "pragmatic"
- We provide _direction_ and _recommended choices made_
  (instead of overloading students with too many options)
- We favour cloud web based instead of locally installed tools
- We make it possible to use on mobile devices like phones and tables
