# About Learn.study

## History

Learn.study was started by [Michael Vorburger.ch](https://www.vorburger.ch) in November 2023 to make a little website for his daughter.

## Principles

- We make it "fun"
- We keep it "short"
- We make it "practical", "hands on", "pragmatic"
- We keep it "readably fluently" and "avoid distractions".
  Most external links are typically only provided in _Further Resources_ at the end.
- We provide _direction_ and _recommended choices made_
  (instead of overloading students with too many options)
- We favour cloud web based instead of locally installed tools
- We make it possible to use on mobile devices like phones and tables

## Technologies

These are the technologies used to build https://www.learn.study itself:

- Markdown (MD)
- Visual Studio Code (VSC) on Web
- GitHub Actions for Continous Integration Builds et al.
  & GitHub Pages for hosting on a content distribution network (CDN)
- Google's https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools to generate Codelabs HTML from MD
- Google Analytics to measure site visitors
- https://megalinter.io

The intention is to (eventually) have lessons here for each of these - so you can build your own startup!

<!-- TODO Link to learn/ lessons introducing each of these technologies! -->

<!-- TODO Move this to a learn/meta/technology/README.md and generate a presentation from it? -->
