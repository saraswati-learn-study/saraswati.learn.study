# Learn.study & ...

Competition is healthy; let's compare this site to others!

## Khan Academy

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) is the grand old #eduTech - of course - hats off!

[Its Computing courses](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing) do have a little bit of overlap. It has a lot (lot) more content, of course.

The format is different, both e.g. with the focus on videos, and the JS-only playground.

_"E pluribus unum?"_

## freeCodeCamp.org

https://www.freecodecamp.org is incredible!

It's [fully open source](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/), both content & tech.

It seems to have a huge community and lists 4-5k (active?) volunteers - amazing story!

It's a non-profit, with [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCodeCamp) 46 staff.

Funding model: They do show Ads, have [Sponsors](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/sponsors/) and take [small donations](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate/).

At first sight looks like it's English-only, because there is no Change Language sort of UI (yet?).

But [translations are being worked on](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/help-translate-freecodecamp-language/), see e.g. https://chinese.freecodecamp.org = https://www.freecodecamp.org/chinese/; but nothing in French as of 2023-10-30.

Maybe there is room for future collaboration?

## W3Schools

Free, but not open source.

Ads- & Subscription-based business model.

Not open for users to contribute to ([source](https://w3schools.invisionzone.com/topic/63231-how-can-i-contribute/)).

Monthly $5/10/30 Subscription model, see bottom of https://www.w3schools.com/signup.

## Modulo

See https://modulo-info.ch, and sources at https://github.com/edunumsec2/book.

Maybe there could be some form of collaboration, or complementary, in the future?

### Same

- Fully open source, both content & tech! Yay, kudos VD.ch.
- [CC BY-NC-SA licensed](https://github.com/edunumsec2/book/blob/master/LICENCE.md),
  similar enough to [our CC-BY-SA](https://github.com/www-learn-study/saraswati.learn.study/blob/main/LICENSE) - but NC

### Better in Modulo

- Nice web design
- _Codeplay_ for Python-in-browser - cool.
- Great content!

### Better (#planned) in Learn.study

- Slides
- Terminal command line etc. type lessons
- Multi-lingual (Modulo is French only, target only local schools in 1 canton of western Switzerland)
- Modulo uses a verbose text heavy writing style, different from [our principles](../../principles/)
- https://apprendre.modulo-info.ch/projets/ has all solutions? C'est bcp. moins drÃ´le ainsi... ðŸ˜„
