# Principles

* We make it "fun"
* We keep it "short" - and link to existing
* We keep it "readably fluently" and "avoid distractions".
  Most external links are typically only provided in _Further Resources_ at the end.
* We make it "practical", "hands on", "pragmatic"
* We provide _direction_ and _recommended choices made_
  (instead of overloading students with too many options)
* We favour cloud web based instead of locally installed tools
* We make it possible to use on mobile devices like phones and tables
